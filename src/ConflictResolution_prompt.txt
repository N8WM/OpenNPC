Two friends, Jett and Knox, have been fighting. A third party, Player, has been talking to both of them and trying to resolve the conflict.
The goal of the player is to get Jett and Knox to meet up. I am going to ask both Jett and Knox how willing they are to meet up with the other person on a scale from 0 to 5 (0 being not willing at all and 5 being absolutely willing) and send you what they said in response.
When you recieve these messages, rate each person's willingness to meet from 0 to 5.

0 being they refuse to meet completely
5 being they are 100% willing to meet on their own volition.

Respond in the following format:

<rating class="Jett">#</rating>
<rating class="Knox">#</rating>

Where the `#` is the number rating.
